# 📰 Fake News Detection System

This is a simple yet powerful Fake News Detection system built with Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning using the **scikit-learn** library. It classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** based on their content. An optional Streamlit web app is included for an interactive experience.

## 📌 Features

- Clean and preprocess news text using NLP
- Train a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF vectorization
- Detect fake or real news articles with high accuracy
- Simple web interface built using **Streamlit**
- Modular structure for training and prediction
